description: "The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle was the second of Hugh Lofting's Doctor\
  \ Dolittle books to be published, coming out in 1922. It is nearly four times longer\
  \ than its predecessor and the writing style is pitched at a more mature audience.\
  \ The scope of the novel is vast; it is divided into six parts and the illustrations\
  \ are also more sophisticated. It won the Newbery Medal for 1923.\nThe original\
  \ edition contains several derogatory terms for Africans that are removed from modern\
  \ editions in certain countries. Some illustrations have also been removed.\n\n\n\
